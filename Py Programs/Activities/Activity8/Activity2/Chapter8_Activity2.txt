CSCI 236 Python Programming Fall 2018


Chapter 8 Activity 2




1.	Write a Python program to replace last value of tuples in a list.
              Sample list: [(10, 20, 40), (40, 50, 60), (70, 80, 90)] 
               Expected Output: [(10, 20, 100), (40, 50, 100), (70, 80, 100)]

             Hint: in python tuple, concatenation can be performed as (1, 2) + (3,) = (1, 2, 3) since
              Tuple is a sequence like string.


2.	Write a Python program to sort a tuple by its float element in decreasing order. 

            Sample data: [('item1', '12.20'), ('item2', '15.10'), ('item3', '24.5')] 
            Expected Output: [('item3', '24.5'), ('item2', '15.10'), ('item1', '12.20')]


3.	Write a Python program to create an intersection of sets.

Sample list: ['Green', 'Blue'] intersect with ['Blue', 'Yellow']
Expected Output : {‘Blue’}



4.	Write a Python program to get the top three items in a shop.

Sample data: {'item1': 45.50, 'item2':35, 'item3': 41.30, 'item4':55, 'item5': 24}
Expected Output: 
item4 55
item1 45.5
item3 41.3
