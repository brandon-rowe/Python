 
1.	Show the output from the following fragments:

a) for i in range(5):
	print(i*i)
b) for d in [3,1,4,1,5]:
	print(d, end=" ")
c) for i in range(4):
	print("Hello")
d) for i in range(5):
	print(i, 2**i)
 


a) 
0
1
4
9
16

b)
3 1 4 1 5

c)
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello

d) 
0 1
1 2
2 4
3 8
4 16

2.	The Python print function supports other keyword parameters besides end. One of these other keyword parameters is sep. What do you think the sep parameter does? Hint: sep is short for separator. Show an example of using the sep parameter here.

 

def main():
    print('09','10','2018','BR', sep='-')
main()

3.	What do you think will happen if the following code is executed?

print("start")
for i in range(0):
	print("Hello")
print("end")
 

It will print the word start, then on a new line, the word end. The For loop is not executed. 

4.	Modify the future value program you write (see chapter 2 slides regarding the future value problem) so that the number of years for the investment is also a user input. Make sure to change the final message to reflect the correct number of years.

	 











# Future Value Program

def main():
    _principalAmt = eval(input("Please enter your principal amount:  "))
    _APR = eval(input("Please enter your APR as a decimal:  "))
    _investYears = eval(input("Please enter the years to invest:  "))


    for i in range(_investYears):
        _interest = (_principalAmt * (1 + _APR))
        _principalAmt = _interest
    print("You will have a balance of",_principalAmt, "after", _investYears,"years.")

main()

def main():
    for i in range(100):
        x = eval(input("Please enter a mathematical expression: "))
        print(x)
main()
