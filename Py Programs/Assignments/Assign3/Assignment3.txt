CSCI 236 Python Programming Fall 2018

Assignment 3


1.	Write a Python function that takes a list and returns a new list with unique elements of the first list.
Sample List : [1,2,3,3,3,3,4,5]
Unique List : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

2.	Write a Python program to print the even numbers from a given list.
Sample List : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] 
Expected Result : [2, 4, 6, 8]

3.	Write a Python function that checks whether a passed string is palindrome or not.
Note: A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam or nurses run.

4.	Write a Python program that accepts a hyphen-separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a hyphen-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
Sample Items : green-red-yellow-black-white 
Expected Result : black-green-red-white-yellow

5.	Write a Python program to reverse a string.
Sample String : "1234abcd"
Expected Output : "dcba4321"

6.	Write a Python function that takes a number as a parameter and check the number is prime or not.

Note : A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 and that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

7.	Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j.

Note: i=0,1…, X-1; j=0,1,…¬,Y-1.
Suppose the following inputs are given to the program:3,5
Then, the output of the program should be:
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]]
