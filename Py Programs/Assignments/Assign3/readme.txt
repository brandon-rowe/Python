Hello Dr. Zhao,

For questions 1 & 2, I added a little code to read a file and 
input the number. You can input your own file if you would like. 
Just leave off the .txt when prompted for the file name. Also, 
if you use (,)'s to separate the numbers in your file, the program 
is already set up to handle that delimiter. However, if you wanted 
to use a file without (,)'s then I have a line of code to use a 
space (" ") as delimiter.

Also, question 6 gave me some trouble with the loop. My code works
correctly but still prints that the number is a prime number at the 
end of every iteration. If the number is a prime number, it will just 
print that the number is a prime number 1 time. If it is not a prime 
number, it will print "num is not a prime number" every time it hits an 
iteration that divides into it but still prints "num is a prime number" 
at the end. I cannot figure out the indention to save my life.


Thank you for your time and I look forward to class next week.


Sincerely,

B. Rowe
