Dr. Zhao,

The monty.py file is the simulation before giving the player an option to change doors.
montyFinal.py is the simulation after giving the player an option to change doors.

I knew from statistics that when the player is originally asked to pick a door, they have a 33% chance of guessing correctly. But after the removal of one door when the player is asked to pick again, they have a 66% chance of guessing correctly.

My simulation proved this hypothesis by raising the range of success by around 10% on the second simulation. Sample set limited to 50 games.

Original simulation ranges from 28% - 42% success rate.
Second simulation ranges from 40% - 56% success rate.
